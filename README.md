# Info343 Final Project Proposal
### Our project idea is to create a website for a friend who is a local DJ

We will create a website that includes a short personal biography which includes his experiences as a DJ. We will also implement UI routing to switch to different page views, include music selections and pictures, a contact form, storage through FireBase, and the ability to adjust through different device sizes. This will allow us to utilize the things we have learned throughout this class.
