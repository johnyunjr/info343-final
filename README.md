# Info343 Final Project Proposal
## Our project idea is to create a website for a friend who is a local DJ

We will create a website that includes a short personal bio which includes his experiences as a DJ.
We will also implement UI routing to switch to different page views, include music selections and pictures, a contact , and the ability t adjust through different device sizes. This will allow us to utilize the things we have learned throughout this class.
