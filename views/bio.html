        <h2>Brennan's Story</h2>
        <p>Ever since the age of 14, Breezee has been breaking from the 'norm' to breathe fresh air into the EDM world with his own individualization of the ever-changing music scene. His distinctive twist on conventional techniques, skillfully blended with his passion to bring energy into all of his tracks, clearly sets him apart from the rest. His seamless blend of electronic music, paired with stylistic elements of tropical house, dreamy melodies, and even trap/future bass accents, creates a musical style that is brand new to the music scene. Breezee has been energizing crowds all around Seattle and LA, being both the owner of a mobile entertainment business and a featured performer at many night clubs in the greater Seattle area. As a producer who has won multiple official remix and producing contests, Breezee has been featured as an official remix artist on Dada Life’s “So Young So High” remix album, and has landed a residency at Seattle's newest hotspot; Stage nightclub. Breezee has only scratched the surface of what will surely be a revolutionary enrichment to the dance music community. His unique artistic style is gaining attention at impressive rates, which will only be further amplified by his soon-to-come remixes and original hits.</p>
